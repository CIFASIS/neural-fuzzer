  "body": "Neural-Fuzzer is an experimental fuzzer designed to use state-of-the-art Machine Learning to learn from a set of initial files. It works in two phases: **training** and **generation**.\r\n\r\n* In training mode:  it uses [long-short term memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) to learn how sequences of bytes are structured. \r\n\r\n* In generation mode: it will automatically generate corrupted or unexpected files and it will try to crash a given program. \r\n\r\nNeural-Fuzzer is powered by [keras](http://keras.io) and it is similar to [rnn-char](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) and other techniques in sequence prediction.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Basic triage of crashes found using GDB.\r\n* CPU and GPU supported! (you can train in GPU but later use your CPU to generate files and test your program).\r\n* Test your program while in the training phase.\r\n\r\n## Getting started with Neural-Fuzzer\r\n\r\n1. Install the [last version of keras](http://keras.io/#installation).\r\n1. Clone our repository:\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/CIFASIS/neural-fuzzer/\r\n1. ... \r\n\r\n## Pre-trained generators\r\n\r\n* Jpeg\r\n* Png\r\n* Xml\r\n* Pdf?\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n* Gustavo **Grieco** (dev)\r\n* Guillermo Luis **Grinblat**\r\n* Lucas **Uzal**",
