  "body": "Neural-Fuzzer is an experimental fuzzer designed to use Machine Learning to learn from a set of initial files. It uses [long-short term memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) to learn how sequences of bytes are structured. After it is trained, it will automatically generate corrupted or unexpected files and it will try to crash a given program. It follows the same technique as [rnn-char](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) and other experiments.\r\n\r\n## Getting started with Neural-Fuzzer\r\n\r\n1. Install the [last version of keras](http://keras.io/#installation).\r\n1. Clone our repository:\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/CIFASIS/neural-fuzzer/\r\n1. ... \r\n",
